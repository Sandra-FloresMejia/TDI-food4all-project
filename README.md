# TDI-food4all-project
With this project I want to ID the population in the US that have low access to food and ID the with the existing small &amp; medium farms in the area.  Then for each cluster of low-food accesibility, ID a lot that could be used as a food-hub by local farmers either to sell their products directly or to set-up a fresh-food home-delivery local distribution center.
