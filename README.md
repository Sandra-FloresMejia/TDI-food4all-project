# TDI-food4all-project
With this project I want to ID the population in the US that have low access to food and break it down by key some demographics: age group, income,  (including SNAP beneficiaries) and access to a car. Also, I will  ID  with the existing small &amp; medium farms in the area.  

Then for each cluster of low-food accesibility, I will ID a location, based on certain parameters such as : close to main roads, accessible via public transportation by local farmers to sell their products directly. The information gathered here, could also be used to set-up a local food-hub, supplied by local farmers, that could include a fresh-food home delivery service.
